FIrst the user needs to upload the Numind API Key in the streamlit side bar (either copy paste or upload a file), then He can upload sample resumes (upto 5) (both pdf and Docx supported) and sample JD (either txt file or streamlit text input (live editing possible in this case))

then PDF plaumber will be used to extract raw text from the resume and normal text parsing from JD. 

then both the text will go to the Numind/Nuextract model which will then return the output in structured format (JSON format). 

then the skills (required from JD and the present ones from resume) will be taken and semantic similarity will be calculated using SBERT (Lm-v6) that will be the skill score. 
Then the experience will be takes from JD (required experience) and Resume (the experience the candidate have) and both will go to the local Llama3.2-3B model in Ollama+Litellm , it will give an experience score and also an proper explanation/justification. 

Then both the scores will be aggregated (final_score = 0.6*skill_score + 0.4*experience_score)

this final score will be used to rank the candidate among themselves.
